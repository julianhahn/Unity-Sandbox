Hi, you person on the internet.

This is my Sandbox to try as much features of Unity as possible.

Why do people search for code? Normaly, because they have a problem.
I've been there, you've been there. 
So if anything from my features help you out, feel free to use them!
*But* if you use my code, I would ask you to copy my repo-link and leave a nice comment on my Github.

Have a nice day!
